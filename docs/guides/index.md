# Guides

The following are guides for reproducing things I have set up more than once. They were written by Past Dom in an effort to help out Future Dom. Thus, they're not really meant to be used by others. However if others find them useful, that's great.

Some of them are kept up-to-date, others not so much. It really depends on how much use Future Dom is getting out of them.
