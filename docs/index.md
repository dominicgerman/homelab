# Homelab

This is where I try to keep up-to-date documentation for my homelab. I'm frequently tearing down and rebuilding things and it's nice to have a record of how things were set up in the past.

I define my homelab as "the servers, networking gear, and self-hosted applications I'm running both on my LAN and in cloud environments." It could just as easily be defined as "Dom's Linux journey". I find it's the best, hands-on way to learn about technology.
